CamelCase:
- Time Complexity: the time complexity for camel case is O(n) because the code iterates through 
each character of the string exactly once in a for loop, performing a constant amount of work

- Space Complexity: the space complexity of this code is constant or O(1). The reason for 
this is that the code uses a fixed amount of additional memory regardless of the input size.

Correctness and the Loop Invariant

- Time Complexity: the average case for time complexity for this code is O(n^2) where 'n' is 
the number of elements in the input array 'A', since this is a nested loop.

- Space Complexity: the space complexity of this code is constant or O(1) also because
the space complexity of this code is constant regardless of the size of the array.
